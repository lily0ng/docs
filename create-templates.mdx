### **What are Marketplace Apps?**

- Marketplace apps are similar to normal VM templates but come with **pre-installed applications**.
- The **service provider** is responsible for preparing these images/templates with the required applications already installed.
- Example: A WordPress Marketplace App is essentially a VM image where the cloud provider has pre-installed **WordPress** on an OS like **Ubuntu** or **CentOS**.
- This allows end users to deploy ready-to-use applications quickly without manual installation.

### **What are Environment Variables and Their Role in Marketplace Apps?**

- During deployment, certain application settings need to be configured **dynamically**.
- Example: For a WordPress app, the **username**, **password**, and **site URL** must be set at deployment time.
