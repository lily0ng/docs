## **Compute Instance**

A **Compute Instance** is a virtual server in the cloud that functions similarly to a physical computer. It has its own CPU, memory, and storage, allowing you to install software, run applications, or host websites. With a Compute Instance, you have complete control over your server environment, making it flexible for various tasks. Compute Instances are a fundamental component of cloud services, enabling users to quickly launch and scale servers as needed.

- **Memory Dense Plus**: Memory-Dense Plus Instances offer a 1:8 CPU-to-memory ratio, providing maximum memory capacity for the most demanding workloads. With high-performance CPUs and ultra-fast NVMe SSD storage.
- **Memory Dense**: Memory-Dense Instances feature a 1:6 CPU-to-memory ratio, delivering high memory capacity for workloads that require extensive data processing. Powered by high-performance CPUs and NVMe SSD storage.
- **Compute Dense Plus**: Extra CPU-Optimized Instances offer a 1:1 CPU-to-Memory ratio, delivering superior processing power with high-frequency CPUs (1 GHz+) and ultra-fast NVMe SSD storage.
- **Compute Dense**: CPU-Optimized Instances feature a 1:2 CPU-to-memory ratio, balancing high-performance processing with increased memory capacity. Powered by high-frequency CPUs and NVMe SSD storage.
- **Balance**: Balanced Instances offer a 1:4 CPU-to-memory ratio, providing an optimal mix of compute power and memory efficiency. With high-performance CPUs and NVMe SSD storage.

### **Assign to a Project**

- Assign the server to one of your projects to organize and manage resources effectively.

- **Public Network**: A simple, pre-configured network designed for external connectivity. Includes cloud firewall protection, port forwarding, and remote access VPN. Ideal for users who require straightforward, hassle-free connectivity.
- **VPC Network**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering complete control over traffic routing and enhanced security. Supports VPN gateway, site-to-site VPN connections, and traffic segregation for better security and performance.

**Note:** By default, a VPC is created with a random **CIDR** block and one network tier.

- You can choose whether to enable public IPv4 for internet access to your server.

### **Configure Server Settings**

- Configure additional settings for your server:
  - **Add SSH Key** for secure access. Click on **Add Now** to add an SSH key.
  - **Note**: For some OS images, such as Arch Linux, an SSH key is required because password login is not supported.
