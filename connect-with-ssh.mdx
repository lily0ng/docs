### **Connecting to Your Instance via SSH**

Before connecting to your instance, ensure you have the following information:

- **IP Address**: Available on the instance card or Virtual Machine Overview.
- **Default Username**: Depending on the operating system (`root`, `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`).
- **Authentication Method**:
  - **SSH Key (recommended)** — Ensure you have access to your private key file.
  - **Default Password** — Found in the Virtual Machine Overview if not using an SSH key.
