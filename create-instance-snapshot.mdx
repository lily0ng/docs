## **Snapshot of Virtual Machine Instance**

**Instance snapshots** allow you to capture the current state of a virtual machine (VM), including its configuration and data, at a specific point in time. Snapshots are a powerful tool for backup, disaster recovery, and testing purposes. They enable you to quickly restore your VM to the exact state when the snapshot was taken, ensuring data consistency and minimizing downtime in case of failures or accidental changes.

**1CNG** provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing instance snapshots, helping you safeguard your VM data and maintain operational continuity. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an instance snapshot using **1CNG**.
