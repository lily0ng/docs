## **Load Balancer**

A **Load Balancer** helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability, reliability, and improved performance. In 1CNG, you can set up a Load Balancer to handle web applications, databases, and other services efficiently. This guide will walk you through the steps to configure a Load Balancer in 1CNG.

### **Creating a Load Balancer**

- From the left-hand side menu, click on the **Load Balancer** tab.
- To create a load balancer, click the **Load Balancer** or **plus (+)** icon located on the right side of the page. This will open the load balancer creation menu.

### **Set Forwarding Rules**

- Configure forwarding rules to define how traffic should be distributed across your servers.
- Provide a unique **Rule Name** for the forwarding rule. Choose the appropriate **Protocol** (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS). Specify the port range for incoming traffic.
- Select an algorithm to distribute incoming requests among instances:
  - **Source** – Directs traffic to the same instance based on the client’s source IP.
  - **Round Robin** – Distributes traffic evenly across all available instances.
  - **Least Connections** – Sends traffic to the instance with the fewest active connections.
- You can enable **Sticky sessions** ensure that a user’s requests are consistently routed to the same backend instance.
  - **LB Cookie** – Uses a load balancer-generated cookie to maintain session persistence.
  - **App Cookie** – Uses application-defined cookies for session persistence.
  - **Source-Based** – Binds sessions to a backend instance based on the client’s source IP.
  - **None** – No session persistence; requests are distributed normally.
- Choose the VM instances that will handle incoming traffic.

### **Create Load Balancer**

- Choose the desired **Billing Cycle** for your load balancer. Load Balancer supports Hourly, Monthly, Quarterly, Semiannually, Yearly, Bi-annually, and Tri-annually billing cycles.
- The billing rules it supports include Date to Date, Fixed Calendar Month, Unfixed Calendar Month, Fixed Prorata, and Unfixed Prorata.
- Only one load balancer package is available per zone. This simplifies configuration and ensures consistent behavior within each deployment zone.
- Verify all the configuration details and review the price summary. Click on **Create Load Balancer** to create the load balancer for your network.
