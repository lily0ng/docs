## **Resource Monitoring**

1CNG's **Resource Monitoring** is an opt-in service that enables real-time tracking of resource utilization for your Instances within the 1CNG. This service collects and displays key performance metrics, helping you assess availability, reliability, and overall system efficiency.

- To monitor resources, go to the **Usage Graphics** tab.
- The **Usage Graphics Page** provides a comprehensive overview of all virtual machines.

### **Network Traffic**

The **Network Traffic Chart** visually represents data flow across a network over time. Use this chart to monitor network performance, identify traffic patterns, and troubleshoot network-related issues.
