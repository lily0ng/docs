## **Virtual Network Function Appliances**

**Virtualised Network Functions (VNFs)** refer to virtualized software applications that provide network services, such as routers, firewalls, load balancers, and WAN optimizers. Unlike traditional hardware-based network devices, VNFs run on virtualized infrastructure, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.

**1CNG** simplifies the deployment and management of VNF appliances, enabling users to scale and adapt their network infrastructure based on demand. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a VNF appliance using **1CNG**.
