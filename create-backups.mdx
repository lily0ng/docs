## **Instance Backups**

**Backups** create copies of your instance’s data to protect against accidental deletions, software failures, or security threats. By enabling backups, you ensure that a restorable version of your VM is always available if needed.

**1CNG** provides automated backup options on a daily, weekly, or custom schedule, allowing for seamless data recovery without manual intervention. Implementing backups is crucial for safeguarding your data and reducing downtime in case of unexpected issues.
